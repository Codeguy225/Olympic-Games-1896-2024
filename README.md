# **Project Summary**

This project explores the historical data of Olympic medals spanning from 1896 to 2024. The primary objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to national and continental performance in the Olympics. By analyzing this extensive dataset, we aim to understand the factors influencing medal outcomes, such as the age of athletes, types of medals won, and the impact of hosting the Olympics. Additionally, we investigate trends in medal efficiency and examine how hosting the Games affects a countryâ€™s performance. The insights gained from this analysis provide a comprehensive view of how Olympic success has evolved across different nations and continents over time.
